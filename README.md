# SpotifyWDC

To use, do the following:

* npm install
* Create an app on spotify developer platform: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications
* Rename config_template.js to config.js
* In the new config.js file, replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with the appropriate values from your new spotify app.

This config setup is done so that app secrets are not checked into GitHub.
